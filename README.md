### Use Instructions
* Start a local mongodb instance: `brew services start mongodb`
* Start a local node server: `npm start`
* Go to `localhost:8000`
* Sign in with your Google account
* Add a contact, and get that contact to also sign in to the application using that Google account
* Select that contact, and create an event using the event creation fields above the calendar
* Select an available time from the resulting modal. The event is created on the user's and all selected contacts' GCals

### Suggested Features
* Allow contact interaction/event creation to non-Google accounts
* Outlook integration
* Calendar selector
* Automated signup email upon Contact add of a non-existing user
Flex dates (given a date range, find all available times over that range)
* Get event details when clicking on events in BigCal
* Required/Optional attendees (designate some attendees as required, and some as optional for finding open times)
* Make a local calendar

### Bug fixes
Make add/remove contacts more intuitive
Calendar date picker
Dropdown menu for Group options (add/remove contact, delete group, rename group)
